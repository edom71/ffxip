40,b1,e2,8000bf00,00001f68,00001ce9,0022,00,01,02,00,Seia gains the effect of Blink.1

code, ??A, ??B, ??C, conversation#, line#, length, ??D, ??E, ??F, ??G

??A/??B
??D = always 0?
??E = always 1?
??F = 0 for echo/logon/lsmes, 1 for chat, 2 for battle/logout
??G = always 0?

log starts 100 chars in

^?1 seems to mean that the conversation is done; if it isn't there
this is a multi-line thing

ffxip expects ??G to indicate multi-line continuation, but it doesn't

BUGS:
losing a few fights when switching parties
getting confused by mob names with numbers - searching for a number is silly
